## üìñ Documentation Index

### üö® Critical Issues & Quick Fixes
- **[IMPROVEMENTS.md](./IMPROVEMENTS.md)** - **START HERE** - Critical security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and immediate fixes with Claude Code commands

### üèóÔ∏è Long-term Development
- **[DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Complete development roadmap, architecture analysis, and feature planning
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Detailed system architecture, technology stack, and design patterns

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Start Here (Security Issues)
1. **Read [IMPROVEMENTS.md](./IMPROVEMENTS.md) immediately**
2. **Execute security fixes (Week 1 priority)**
3. **Address performance bottlenecks**
4. **Improve code quality**

### üü¢ Long-term Planning
1. Review [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
2. Plan architecture improvements  
3. Schedule technology upgrades
4. Design new features

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

### For New Contributors or Critical Issues
1. **SECURITY FIRST**: Read [IMPROVEMENTS.md](./IMPROVEMENTS.md) and fix critical security issues immediately
2. **Performance**: Address performance bottlenecks affecting users
3. **Quality**: Improve code quality and maintainability
4. **Planning**: Use [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for feature development

### For Feature Development
1. **Read the Development Guide**: Start with [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
2. **Check Current Architecture**: Review the technology stack and architecture analysis
3. **Follow Task Priorities**: Begin with Phase 1 critical tasks
4. **Reference Improvements**: Check [IMPROVEMENTS.md](./IMPROVEMENTS.md) for patterns and fixes

## ü§ñ How to Use with Claude Code

Both documents are optimized for AI agents:

```bash
# For critical fixes
/implement --doc "docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md" --priority "security"

# For feature development  
/implement --doc "docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md" --phase "1"

# For comprehensive analysis
/analyze --reference "docs/" --focus "security,performance,quality"
```

## üìã Documentation Standards

When adding new documentation:
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Add cross-references between related documents
- Update this README.md index
- Use emojis consistently for visual navigation

## üîÑ Document Updates

This documentation is a living resource that should be updated as the project evolves. Please:
- Update task completion status
- Add new architectural decisions
- Document lessons learned
- Revise recommendations based on implementation results
